# robust_speech

Adversarial attacks and defenses on Speech Recognition  - powered by [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain).

Developed in the MLSP lab at CMU. Project led by [Raphael Olivier](https://raphaelolivier.github.io) under the supervision of Prof. Bhiksha Raj.

## What is this package for?
In order to deploy machine learning models in the real world, it is important to make them robust to adversarial perturbations. This includes Automatic Speech Recognition models, which are [well known](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06622) to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Many adversarial attacks and defenses have been developped by various research teams. In order to let users evaluate the robustness of their models, and come up more easily with new defenses, gathering all these attacks under a common codebase can be handy.

Several robustness-oriented packages already exist ([Advertorch](https://github.com/BorealisAI/advertorch), [ART](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox/tree/main/art), [Foolbox](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox), [Cleverhans](https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/cleverhans), etc). However, nearly all of these packages suppose that the model performs image classification. Yet applying standard classification-based attacks is not trivial, as ASR models are typically more complex than a stack of PyTorch layers: they must handle variable length inputs, are trained with tricky losses, contain recurrent networks, etc. Some attacks have been developped with the explicit goal of fooling ASR models (for instance by relying on acoustic models), and these attacks are rarely included in general robustness packages. Out of the packages above, ART supports ASR attacks, and only a small subset of them and limited ASR architectures and datasets.

**robust_speech** fills that gap and propose a simple way to evaluate ASR models against Adversarial attacks. It is based on [Speechbrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/), a flexible Speech Toolkit that makes it very easy to load ASR datasets, run ASR models and access their loss, predictions and error rates - all of which are often necessary to run attacks. We have added some useful features and metrics to the Speechbrain Brain class, and we have imported or reproduced multiple general and ASR-specific attacks.

## Features 

* Run adversarial attacks over a dataset
* Evaluate with Word-Error Rate(WER), Character-Error Rate (CER) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
* Export adversarial examples
* Run an attack over multiple models at once
* Transfer an attack from a source model to a target model.
* Attacks on SpeechBrain models through the brain class over one file
* (In development) Adversarial training

Supported attacks:
* [PGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)
* [CW](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/audio-dls18.pdf)
* [Kenansville](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05262) 
* [Imperceptible](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10346) 
* [Genetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00554)
* [ACL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07589) for Wav2Vec2
* (In development) [MGAA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04204)

The package provised model classes in the form of Speechbrain Brain classes, that are compatible with the attacks above. Currently implemented:
* Sequence-to-Sequence models with RNNs and Transformers, also supporting the CTC loss. Compatible with [pretrained](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech) [speechbrain](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-crdnn-transformerlm-librispeech) [models](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech).
* RNN-CTC model (DeepSpeech-like) with character tokenizer.
* RNN-Transducer models
* Wav2Vec2 ASR and Pretraining (compatible with pretrained huggingface Wav2Vec2 models).

We also provide data preparation and loading functions for the LibriSpeech package, based on SpeechBrain recipes.

## Install 
Before installing robust_speech you should have installed PyTorch (>=1.8.0,<=1.10.1) and cuda support (if you want GPU support) in your environment. Testing was conducting with CUDA 9.2 and 10.2 on a Nvidia RTX 2080Ti. Default options assume GPU support; use the `--device=cpu` option in your scripts if do not have it.

```
git clone https://github.com/RaphaelOlivier/robust_speech.git
cd robust_speech
pip install .
```

## Usage
We provide scripts to train and evaluate models (with adversarial attacks in both stages). These scripts are similar to speechbrain training recipes.

We also provide a number of training and evaluation config files ready for use.

Example

```
# in ./recipes/

# This will download the speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech model from huggingface
python evaluate.py attack_configs/pgd/s2s_1000bpe.yaml --root=/path/to/results/folder 

# This will train a model first
python train.py train_configs/ctc_train.yaml --root=/path/to/results/folder
mv /path/to/training/outputs/folder/*.ckpt /path/to/models/folder/asr-ctcrnn-librispeech/
python evaluate.py attack_configs/pgd/ctc_char.yaml --root=/path/to/results/folder --snr=25
```

Our provided configs assume a results folder structure such as
```
root
│
└───data
│   │ # where datasets are dumped (e.g. download LibriSpeech here)
│
└───models
│   │
│   └───model_name1
│   │   │   model.ckpt
│   
└───tokenizers   
│   │ # where all tokenizers are saved
│   
└───trainings
│   │  # where your custom models are trained
│  
└───attacks
|   |
│   └───attack_name
│   │   │
│   │   └───1234 # seed
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   └───model_name1
│   │   │   │   │ # your attack results

```
You may change this at will in your custom `.yaml` files or with command line arguments
